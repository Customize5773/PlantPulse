# 🌱 PlantPulse: Smart Indoor Plant Monitoring System

**PlantPulse** is a modular, IoT-enabled Arduino-based system for real-time monitoring of indoor plant health. It provides continuous data collection and cloud integration to track **soil moisture**, **temperature**, and **humidity**, with a remote dashboard powered by **Blynk IoT**.

## 📸 Project Overview

Indoor plants play a vital role in enhancing air quality, regulating humidity, and improving indoor aesthetics and well-being. However, maintaining optimal environmental conditions—such as adequate soil moisture, temperature, and humidity—can be challenging due to variability in indoor climates and user oversight.

PlantPulse addresses this challenge by implementing a smart, sensor-driven monitoring system capable of continuously tracking key environmental parameters critical to plant health. The system leverages a Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller (ESP32) to interface with multiple environmental sensors, including a capacitive soil moisture sensor, a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor, and optionally a light sensor for luminance monitoring.

Sensor data is acquired in real time and processed by the ESP32. This data is then transmitted to a cloud-based IoT platform (Blynk) over Wi-Fi, enabling users to access a remote dashboard via a mobile application or web interface. The dashboard provides visual feedback, historical graphing, and the ability to set thresholds for critical parameters.

The PlantPulse system promotes proactive plant care by:
- Providing real-time monitoring and alerts when environmental conditions deviate from plant-healthy ranges.
- Enabling data-driven decisions through historical tracking of environmental trends.
- Supporting modular extensibility, allowing the integration of additional sensors, actuators (e.g., automated watering), and data services (e.g., cloud logging).

By combining embedded sensing, wireless communication, and cloud-based visualization, PlantPulse serves as a practical and scalable solution for precision indoor horticulture, home automation, and environmental monitoring. It is especially relevant in the contexts of smart homes, urban gardening, and sustainable living initiatives.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. 📲 Blynk IoT Setup

1. Go to [https://blynk.cloud](https://blynk.cloud) and create a new account.
2. Create a **new Template**:

   * Name: `PlantPulse Monitor`
   * Hardware: `ESP32 Dev Board`
   * Connection: `WiFi`
3. Create **Datastreams**:

   * V0 → Soil Moisture (Integer)
   * V1 → Temperature (Float)
   * V2 → Humidity (Float)
4. Deploy to a **new device** and copy the:

   * `BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID`
   * `BLYNK_TEMPLATE_NAME`
   * `AUTH_TOKEN`

### 2. 🧰 Arduino Setup

* Install the following libraries using the Arduino Library Manager:

  * `Blynk` (Blynk IoT v1.1.0+)
  * `DHT sensor library by Adafruit`
  * `Adafruit Unified Sensor`
* Set the board to **ESP32 Dev Module**

### 3. 🧾 Code Configuration

In `blynk_interface.h`, update:

```cpp
#define BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID "YourTemplateID"
#define BLYNK_TEMPLATE_NAME "PlantPulse Monitor"
#define BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN "YourAuthToken"

char ssid[] = "YourWiFiSSID";
char pass[] = "YourWiFiPassword";
```

## 🧪 Sensor Calibration

### Soil Moisture Calibration:

Adjust `map()` in `soil_sensor.h` using your sensor's dry/wet readings:

```cpp
int moisturePercent = map(raw, 4095, 1200, 0, 100); // Adjust as needed
```

Use `Serial.println(analogRead(SOIL_PIN))` to get raw values.

---

## 📲 Mobile Dashboard Design (Blynk App)

* Add **Gauge Widgets** or **Labels**
* Bind to:

  * V0 → Soil Moisture
  * V1 → Temperature
  * V2 → Humidity
* Use **History Graph** or **Notification Widget** as needed
